# OLED_SSH1106_I2C
this is a demo sample for SSH1106 OLED with I2C for RPI Pico

For those who deal with SSH1106 1.3' inch OLED rather than SSD1306, I have created a sample repository which works, 

This Repository code is adopted and transferred from the STM32 nucleo board sample described in this link: https://controllerstech.com/oled-display-using-i2c-stm32/


Note that the dimension of the SSH1106 driver must be set to 132X72 to make it work! interestingly dimension of 128X64 doesn't work and the OLED will be turn into a whole dummy screen!
